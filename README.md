# Chat-Valorant-Rank
This API lets you fetch your rank dynamically, typically for making **!rank** command in your Twitch/YouTube stream.


## Usage
Visit [Chat-Valorant-Rank Generator](https://y-gaming.in/chat-valorant-rank/) and select the options as per your requirements and press **Generate**. This will create a link for you to copy and use in whichever bot's custom command you want to.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is it not working?
Please double check the URL you are using. If everything works fine on your end then check if the status of the backend API [here](https://status.henrikdev.xyz/). If that is also up then create an issue with details about the URL you used and what exactly you are facing.
